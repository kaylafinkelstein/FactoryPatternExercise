            //Create a new console app that utilizes factory pattern by taking a user’s input of how many tires are on a
            //vehicle and based on their input, creates that type of vehicle.Complete this using an interface. You must have at
            //least 2 subclasses.For instance, if I type 4 into the console, the program would create a car or truck, or if someone
            //types 2 it would create a motorcycle.
             //Feel free to use something other than vehicles if you want to be creative, but the other constraints still apply!

             //Possible steps:
            //Create an Interface named IVehicle that has a stubbed out public void Drive method
            //Create 2 new public classes that will conform to IVehicle
            //Example) Car, Motorcycle,  BigRig
            //These classes must conform to IVehicle and implement the Drive() method - which will just Console.WriteLine
            //(“Building a new Car!”)
             //Now we will make our static VehicleFactory class
             //It will contain a static method GetVehicle(), that will return an IVehicle based on the amount of tires it’s
             //given as a parameter
             //Call this functionality in the Main method
